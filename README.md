# Sleeping Barber Problem

When I first read about core.async I thought that it should be the right tool to solve some well-known synchronization problems with elegance.

This is my take on Dijkstra's Sleeping Barber Problem.

## Usage

`lein run` would run the code with the default settings.
`sleeping-barber.core-test` namespace ensures some common-sense assumptions are hold true.
